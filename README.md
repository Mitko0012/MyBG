# MyBG
A web app created in ASP.NET Core MVC designed to help foreigners explore Bulgaira

### Components
#### Pages
Any user can submit a page about a destination in Bulgaria. The admins have to approve the content on the page first before it could be made visible.
#### Forum
A forum where users can post questions about the app or a specific destinations. Other users can reply to the user on the forum
#### Roles
Currently there are 2 roles in this app: User and Admin.
The user can add page submissions, and the admin can approve or disapprove them. In the latest alpha build there is yet no way for admins to make users, all admins are hard-coded. In the future the admins will be able to make users admins. I'm also considering a head-admin role.
